# Project3: Riot Of The Grey Rock

## Machine Learning Group Project

For this project we had to idendify a real world problem that needed to be solved. In order to do this we had to analyze a problem using Machine Learning, along with another Machine Learning library, and create some predictions based on our deep dive of the exhisting data. Once we came up with a solution to the problem we then had to create visualizations that explained our final analysis and that could be published on Tableau Public server. 

### Task 1: Identify Real World Problem
For this section of the project, the teammembers met on Zoom and discuss a project proposal to do an analysis on. Each teammember presented topics to the group such as mushroom species, home loan predictions, Honeybee Colonization vs Pesticide use, AirBNB rentals and UBER user retention. After presenting each of our ideas to one another, we decided to do an analysis on Honeybee Colonization. We chose to do Honeybee Colonization vs Neonic Pesticide use because we thought topic was interesting and the dataset was fairly complete. Some of the things that we discussed analyzing and visualizing were. 
* Read Dataset into Jupyter Notebook
* Clean dataset: remove nulls, rename columns
* (ETL) Hawaii missing pesticide data
* Identify potential features that can be created by combining from raw datasets
* Identifing and run models that work with our dataset
* Compare models by success rate
* Assess modeled predictions with dummy data
* Do final visualizations in Tabluea compared to predictive models

Neonic pesticide affects on HoneyBee colonies within the US

### Task 2: Solve Problem with Machine Learning
* Solve the problem by making predictions
* Use Machine Learing
* Use Scikit-Learn and/or another Machine Learing library
* Incorporate two of the following: Python Pandas, Python Matplotlib, HTML/CSS/Bootstrap, JavaScript Plotly, JavaScript D3.js, JavaScript Leaflet, SQL Database, MongoDB Database, Google Cloud SQL, Amazon AWS or Tableau
* If building an app, deploy it to Heroku or another tool of choice.

### Task 3: Create Presentation
* The presentation had to clearly explain our problem, our deep dive analysis and our predicted results
* The presentation had to be 15 minutes or less
* Everyone had to participate in the presentation
* We had to create the presentation in Tablue and publish it to the Tableu Public with links to README.md and GitHub repo

### Submission:
* Link to Google Doc with written analysis of results
* Links to any Google Colab notebooks if used
* Link to Tablue Public Story which explains the process in full
* Link to GitHub Repository where all of the files for project are located
* Collaboration on Jupyter Notebook for Python
* Thorough README.md with detailed explanation of the project steps 
* A link to a live deployed web app that describes the problem, explains process and uses model in real time

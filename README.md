# Project3: Riot Of The Grey Rock

Project status: in process
Most models and many visualizations have been created, pending review of models, summaries, and final presentation document.  

## Machine Learning Group Project

For this project we had to idendify a real world problem that needed to be solved. In order to do this we had to analyze a problem using Machine Learning, along with another Machine Learning library, and create some predictions based on our deep dive of the exhisting data. Once we came up with a solution to the problem we then had to create visualizations that explained our final analysis and that could be published on Tableau Public server. 

### Task 1: Identify Real World Problem
For this section of the project, the teammembers met on Zoom and discuss a project proposal to do an analysis on. Each teammember presented topics to the group such as mushroom species, home loan predictions, Honeybee Colonization vs Pesticide use, AirBNB rentals and UBER user retention. After presenting each of our ideas to one another, we decided to do an analysis on Honeybee Colonization. We chose to do Honeybee Colonization vs Neonic Pesticide use because we thought topic was interesting and the dataset was fairly complete. Some of the things that we discussed analyzing and visualizing were. 
* Read Dataset into Jupyter Notebook
* Clean dataset: remove nulls, rename columns
* (ETL) Hawaii missing pesticide data
* Identify potential features that can be created by combining from raw datasets
* Identifing and run models that work with our dataset
* Compare models by success rate
* Assess modeled predictions with dummy data
* Do final visualizations in Tableau compared to predictive models

### Task 2: Solve Problem with Machine Learning
* Solve the problem by making predictions
The predictions this group was interested in was based on pesticides vs Gowth Outcome. 
* Use Machine Learing
* Use Scikit-Learn and/or another Machine Learing library
* Incorporate two of the following: Python Pandas, Python Matplotlib, HTML/CSS/Bootstrap, JavaScript Plotly, JavaScript D3.js, JavaScript Leaflet, SQL Database, MongoDB Database, Google Cloud SQL, Amazon AWS or Tableau
The group decided on logistic regression, SVC, random forest, and neural network models applied to each of the 5 pesticides as well as the aggregrated pesticide.  To recreate this work, you will need to make sure the various programs and packages in the requirements.txt file are installed on your computer and in your environment.
* If building an app, deploy it to Heroku or another tool of choice.
The group decided against deploying an app and instead used Tableau to create a presentation

### Task 3: Create Presentation
* The presentation had to clearly explain our problem, our deep dive analysis and our predicted results
* The presentation had to be 15 minutes or less
* Everyone had to participate in the presentation
* We had to create the presentation in Tablue and publish it to the Tableu Public with links to README.md and GitHub repo

### Submission:
* Link to Google Doc with written analysis of results
* Links to any Google Colab notebooks if used
* Link to Tablue Public Story which explains the process in full
* Link to GitHub Repository where all of the files for project are located
* Collaboration on Jupyter Notebook for Python
* Thorough README.md with detailed explanation of the project steps 
* A link to a live deployed web app that describes the problem, explains process and uses model in real time

### Challenges:
* In raw data, all pesticides were in kilograms instead of pounds.  It was decided to leave as kilograms for the purposes of machine learning as this was consistent across the pesticides and removed a type conversion. However, in the graphical presentation, a conversion was applied to the pesticides to transform into pounds for the purposes of comparing honey prodution vs pesticide application.
* In the logisitic regression model, the first pesticide (scenario) an error reflecting a scalar rquirement occured with the first pesticide (scenario) but not with the remaining pesticides. The warning error was a bit misleading to researching what the solution was. Rabbit hole ensued. The resolution was to apply and increase max iterations to eliminate warnings and errors.
* It was discovered in the neural network model that the only pesticide that were applied outside of a combination of other pesticides was ImidaclopridLB (pesticide 2).  Therefore applying filters to create the different scenarios ended with no records for all but ImidaclopridLB.  Instead the scenarios were created by elimintating pesticide fields that were not applicable to the specific scenario.

### Replicate the process:
* From the websit link above, download vHoneyNeonic_v03.csv.
* First data application is to add two fields in the data set in Excel. (Note to future selves: figure out how to do this in Python).  THese would be Colony Growth and Colony Outcome.  Colony growth is the rate of change per number of colonies based on state and year.  Growth outcome is a binary field based on colony growth.  (0 for growth loss or no growth, 1 for growth increase.) 
* Set up a new conda environment using reqirements.txt.  Then activate to start running the process.
* In the logisitic regression model, the first pesticide (scenario) reflected a scalar requirement error but not with the remaining pesticides. The warning error was a bit misleading to researching what the solution was. Rabbit hole ensued. The resolution was to apply and increase max iterations to eliminate warnings and errors.
* It was discover

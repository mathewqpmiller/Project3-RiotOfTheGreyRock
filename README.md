# Project3: Riot Of The Grey Rock

## Machine Learning Group Project

For this project we had to idendify a real world problem that needed to be solved. In order to do this we had to analyze a problem using Machine Learning, along with another Machine Learning library, and create some predictions based on our deep dive of the exhisting data. Once we came up with a solution to the problem we then had to create visualizations that explained our final analysis and that could be published on Tableau Public server. 

### Task 1: Identify Real World Problem
* Find a real world problem and an associated dataset

### Task 2: Solve Problem with Machine Learning
* Solve the problem by making predictions
* Use Machine Learing
* Use Scikit-Learn and/or another Machine Learing library
* Incorporate two of the following: Python Pandas, Python Matplotlib, HTML/CSS/Bootstrap, JavaScript Plotly, JavaScript D3.js, JavaScript Leaflet, SQL Database, MongoDB Database, Google Cloud SQL, Amazon AWS or Tableau
* If building an app, deploy it to Heroku or another tool of choice.

### Task 3: Create Presentation
* The presentation had to clearly explain our problem, our deep dive analysis and our predicted results
* The presentation had to be 15 minutes or less
* Everyone had to participate in the presentation
* We had to create the presentation in Tablue and publish it to the Tableu Public with links to README.md and GitHub repo

### Submission:
* Link to Google Doc with written analysis of results
* Links to any Google Colab notebooks if used
* Link to Tablue Public Story which explains the process in full
* Link to GitHub Repository where all of the files for project are located
* Collaboration on Jupyter Notebook for Python
* Thorough README.md with detailed explanation of the project steps 
* A link to a live deployed web app that describes the problem, explains process and uses model in real time
